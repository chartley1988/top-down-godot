# Project Structure
The project folder is divided into several key features.

- `/source`: 
The source folder contains the main engine for the game. Logic such as movement, battles, inventory live in the source folder.

- `/same`:
The game folder contains the main content of the project. Files for maps, events, and data are stored here. Most contents of the game folder should be 'instances' of classes, rather than any new definitions.
